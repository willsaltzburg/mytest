This is my first attempt at creating a github repositorty (repo)

My name is William Saltzburg and I am a student in American University's GOVT-470-001, Intro to Applied Political Data Science, in the Fall 2020 semester. This is my first GitHub repository, to satisfy the requirements for Problem Set 07 (PS07).
